All 3 parts of the assignment are in this repo.

Disclaimer

This repository was not made to allow other students to blatantly steal code to cheat on their assigments. This was created to allow students to verify their code against a working example after the assignment has already been completed. Additionally, I am not perfect, so the code presented here might not necessarily be 100% correct, bug free, or up to one's standards. If so, please let me know so I can fix it.
